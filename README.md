this project is my humble attempt to optimize exponential complexity of the groundstates search process in spin glass structures  
here i am taking 8x8 spin glass as an example  
trying to go through spin glass matrix in 4 different directions diagonally: UP_LEFT, BOTTOM_LEFT, UP_RIGHT, BOTTOM_RIGHT and get all possible spin configurations which give us minimum possible energy
