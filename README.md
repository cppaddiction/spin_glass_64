This project is my humble attempt to optimize the exponential complexity of the groundstates search process in spin glass structures.  
Here i am taking 8x8 spin glass matrix as an example.  
Trying to go through spin glass matrix in 4 different directions diagonally: up_left, up_right, down_left, down_right and get all possible spin configurations with minimum energy.
